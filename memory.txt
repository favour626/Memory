Memory

The Memory Game is a classic matching game that tests and improves players' memory skills. The game is played by flipping 
over pairs of cards, with the goal of finding matching pairs. Each card contains a unique image or symbol, and the 
player's task is to remember where each image is located on the game board. The game is won by correctly matching all of the pairs
on the board.

The Memory Game can be played by one or more players, and the game can be customized by changing the number of cards, the 
size of the game board, and the type of images or symbols used on the cards. The game can be played on a computer or a 
mobile device, and can be implemented using various programming languages and technologies.

Overall, the Memory Game is a fun and challenging way to exercise and improve memory skills, and is suitable for players 
of all ages. In the second option, the user engages by learning a random number (6-13 digits) within a specific time limit
 and then inputting it after the time runs out. With specific game modes like multiplayer and infinite, the second option 
also embodies a lot of fun.

It was a fun project to work on because i used many different libraries (popular and unpopular) and alternated between 
them before finally discarding them for my own written solution.
